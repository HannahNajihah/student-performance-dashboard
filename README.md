# 🎓 Agile Data Science for Student Performance Prediction and Visualisation

## 📌 Overview
Student performance is shaped by a mix of academic and non-academic factors such as **study time, sleep, attendance, and motivation**. This project applies **Agile Data Science techniques** to educational data, using **explainable machine learning** and **interactive Streamlit dashboards** to uncover performance drivers and predict exam outcomes.  

The goal is to support:
- **Teachers** in monitoring performance, predicting scores, and identifying high-risk students.
- **Students** in exploring lifestyle factors like sleep habits to improve study strategies.
- **Institutions** in promoting early intervention through data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features
### Dashboards (Streamlit)
1. **Exam Score Predictor (Teachers)**  
   - Predict scores using study time, sleep hours, and attendance.  
   - “What-if” scenarios for personalised teaching strategies.  

2. **Sleep vs Performance Analysis (Students)**  
   - Explore how sleep duration influences grades.  
   - Interactive scatter plots, trendlines, and prediction forms.  

3. **High-Risk Student Identifier (Teachers)**  
   - Highlight students at risk of underperformance.  
   - Custom risk thresholds, scatter plots, and student tables.  

### Development Highlights
- ✅ **Agile Workflow** with sprints and user stories (managed in Asana).  
- ✅ **Preprocessing Pipeline**: missing values, encoding, outlier removal.  
- ✅ **Regression Model** integrated with dashboards.  
- ✅ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** for testing and deployment.  
- ✅ **MVD (Minimum Viable Dashboard)** → Iterative feature expansion.
